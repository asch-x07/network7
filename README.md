# Image Classifier with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to create synthetic images for data augmentation and improve the performance of an **image classification model**. The project is developed in Python using libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks — a **generator** and a **discriminator** — compete with each other in a zero-sum game. This project uses GANs to:
1. Generate synthetic training images to enhance datasets.
2. Improve the accuracy of an **image classifier** by augmenting with GAN-generated data.

The primary goal of the project is to:
- Train a GAN model capable of generating realistic images.
- Use the augmented dataset to train a robust image classifier.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classifier-gan.git
   cd image-classifier-gan
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### 1. Train the GAN
Run the GAN training script to generate synthetic images:
```bash
python main.py --mode train_gan --epochs 100
```
This will:
- Train the generator and discriminator models.
- Save generated images to the `results/images/` directory.

### 2. Generate Synthetic Images
To generate images using the pre-trained GAN model:
```bash
python main.py --mode generate --num_images 100
```

### 3. Train the Image Classifier
Train the image classifier using the augmented dataset:
```bash
python main.py --mode train_classifier --epochs 50
```

### 4. Evaluate the Classifier
Evaluate the classifier's performance on the test dataset:
```bash
python main.py --mode evaluate
```

## Results

### GAN Performance
- **Generator Loss**: The quality of generated images improves as the generator loss decreases.
- **Discriminator Accuracy**: Tracks how well the discriminator distinguishes between real and fake images.

### Classifier Accuracy
- **Baseline Model**: Classifier trained on the original dataset.
- **Augmented Model**: Classifier trained on the augmented dataset (original + GAN-generated images).

| Model              | Accuracy (%) |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Baseline           | 85.6         |
| Augmented Dataset  | 92.4         |

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** or **PyTorch**
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
- **scikit-learn** for evaluation metrics

---

## Future Work

- Fine-tune the GAN for higher-quality image generation.
- Experiment with different GAN architectures (e.g., DCGAN, StyleGAN).
- Extend the project to multi-class classification tasks.
- Explore other data augmentation techniques and compare results.
